# prediction-flight-delays
 The code utilizes libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and CatBoost for building a machine learning model to predict flight delays. It preprocesses data, splits it into training and testing sets, and employs classifiers such as CatBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
