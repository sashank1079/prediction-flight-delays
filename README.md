# prediction-flight-delays
 The code utilizes libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and CatBoost for building a machine learning model to predict flight delays. It preprocesses data, splits it into training and testing sets, and employs classifiers such as CatBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.


Instead of obtaining the dataset directly from Kaggle, data was sourced from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics website for February 2020. After careful analysis, nine variables were manually selected to predict flight delays: MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK, OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER, ORIGIN, DEST, DEP_TIME, DEP_DEL15, and DISTANCE.
